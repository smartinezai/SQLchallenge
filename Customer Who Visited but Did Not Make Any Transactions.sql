# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT  Visits.customer_id, COUNT(Visits.customer_id) as count_no_trans #STEP 1. WHAT DO WE WANT THE OUTPUT TABLE COLUMNS TO BE
FROM Visits LEFT JOIN Transactions USING(visit_id)#FROM WHERE ARE WE GETTING THAT INFO
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL #condition
GROUP BY Visits.customer_id #so that we display the count for each ID instead of having just one row with the count of visitis without purchases
